# bmessenger.github.io

This is my personal portfolio site and is being rendered using [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).  

This site is easy to maintain, quick to update, readily accessible to the public, and scores 100/100 on Google Page Speed Insights.  I'm somewhat of a utilitarian personality and believe websites should serve a purpose in delivering easy to absorb content.  [Get rid of the fluff](http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/).  

That's it.  Feel free to poke around and use whatever you want, it's all free and there's nothing to hide.  I simply followed the step-by-step guide on the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/) website.
